# CSV object import and export

This package contains code and examples for import and exporting data from a serialize-able list of any flat data structure. (A flat data structure has no nested data. Nested data wouldn't map onto the `CSV` format very well.)

## Installation

Import the package contents. For the functionality you only need to include to `Code` sub-folder. The `Documentation` and `Examples` are optional. The package file is here:
